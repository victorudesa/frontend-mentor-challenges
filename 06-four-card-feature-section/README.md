## Overview

In this challenge, I wanted to practice speed and focus on building a clean and professional solution. I continued leveraging the BEM and ITCSS methodologies to structure my CSS, and I successfully implemented CSS Grid for the first time to handle the three-column responsive layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Simple CSS Reset
- @media queries
- Pseudo-classes (::marker and :last-child)

### What I learned

* Reinforced and enhanced my proficiency in Semantic HTML and accessible practices, ensuring a robust document structure.
* Significantly deepened my practical application of Media Queries for building fully responsive designs across various screen sizes.
* Enhanced CSS architecture with BEM and ITCSS.

### Continued development

* My next development phase will focus heavily on architecting CSS using ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) and rigorously applying the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention to all components.
* This will further enhance my ability to build sophisticated and maintainable responsive designs, including continued exploration of CSS Grid for complex layouts.
