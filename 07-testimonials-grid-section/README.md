## Overview

The focus here was 100% on CSS Grid! This project served as a hands-on playground to practice all the essential concepts of this layout model: I explored everything from implicit tracks to the strategic use of grid areas.
To refine the result, I checked out Kevin Powell's solution and absorbed some valuable tricks on spacing and responsivenessâ€”including the neat tip that you don't always need to apply padding to the body element. It was a great exercise in modern best practices!

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Grids) - MDN is a cornerstone reference in web development, especially for best practices. This article, like many others from their website, made Grid a lot clearer.
- [W3 - CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - The W3C is also a huge reference, and it's beneficial to draw knowledge from different sources.
- [Design Systems](https://www.designsystems.com/) - A great resource for understanding component structure and layout planning.
- [CSS Minimal Reset](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-minimal-css-reset)
