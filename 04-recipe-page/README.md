## Overview

This marks my fourth Frontend Mentor challenge. I'm excited by the noticeable increase in development speed this project demonstrated, building upon my previous experiences. I actively focused on refining my understanding of Semantic HTML and Media Queries, leading to a more efficient and robust solution overall.

## My process

My process began with recreating the design in Figma, helping to map out the structure effectively. The HTML phase prioritized building a robust semantic foundation. For the CSS, I consistently leveraged design tokens and particularly focused on enhancing my use of Media Queries, resulting in a quicker and more adaptable solution.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Simple CSS Reset
- @media queries
- Pseudo-classes (::marker and :last-child)

### What I learned

* Reinforced and enhanced my proficiency in Semantic HTML and accessible practices, ensuring a robust document structure.
* Significantly deepened my practical application of Media Queries for building fully responsive designs across various screen sizes.
* Further refined my CSS organization, leveraging custom properties (design tokens) for efficiency and maintainability.
* Successfully implemented local font imports using @font-face, optimizing performance and control over typography.

### Continued development

* My next development phase will focus heavily on architecting CSS using ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) and rigorously applying the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention to all components.
* This will further enhance my ability to build sophisticated and maintainable responsive designs, including continued exploration of CSS Grid for complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - MDN is a cornerstone reference in web development, especially for best practices. This article, like many others from their website, made Flexbox a lot clearer.
- [W3 - CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - The W3C is also a huge reference, and it's beneficial to draw knowledge from different sources.
- [Design Systems](https://www.designsystems.com/)
