## Overview

The focus here was 100% on CSS Grid! This project served as a hands-on playground to practice all the essential concepts of this layout model: I explored everything from implicit tracks to the strategic use of grid areas.
To refine the result, I checked out Kevin Powell's solution and absorbed some valuable tricks on spacing and responsivenessâ€”including the neat tip that you don't always need to apply padding to the body element. It was a great exercise in modern best practices!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Simple CSS Reset
- @media queries
- Pseudo-classes (::marker and :last-child)

### What I learned

* Reinforced and enhanced my proficiency in Semantic HTML and accessible practices, ensuring a robust document structure.
* Significantly deepened my practical application of Media Queries for building fully responsive designs across various screen sizes.
* Enhanced CSS architecture with BEM and ITCSS.

### Continued development

* My next development phase will focus heavily on architecting CSS using ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) and rigorously applying the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention to all components.
* This will further enhance my ability to build sophisticated and maintainable responsive designs, including continued exploration of CSS Grid for complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - MDN is a cornerstone reference in web development, especially for best practices. This article, like many others from their website, made Flexbox a lot clearer.
- [W3 - CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - The W3C is also a huge reference, and it's beneficial to draw knowledge from different sources.
